# ALFRESCO Master Dataset sha1sums

The *.sha1sums files in this directory were generated by running the following commands on poseidon, the authoritative source of the ALFRESCO master datasets:

```
cd /workspace/Data/Base_Data/ALFRESCO/ALFRESCO_Master_Dataset
find . -type f -exec sha1sum '{}' \; | sort > ALFRESCO_Master_Dataset.sha1sums
```

```
cd /workspace/Data/Base_Data/ALFRESCO/ALFRESCO_Master_Dataset_v2_1
find . -type f -exec sha1sum '{}' \; | sort > ALFRESCO_Master_Dataset_v2_1.sha1sums
```

The same commands can be run against the ALFRESCO master datasets on Atlas to verify the integrity of all files.

The *.sha1sums files have been compressed with gzip to shrink them below GitHub's 100mb file size limit.
